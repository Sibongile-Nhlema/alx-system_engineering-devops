**Root Cause**

The incident was caused by a misconfiguration introduced during a recent update to the caching configuration. This misconfiguration led to an excessive number of cache misses, overwhelming the backend servers and resulting in slow response times or errors for dashboard users.

**Resolution and Recovery**

Upon detection of the issue at 8:12 AM GMT, our team promptly investigated and escalated the incident. By 9:20 AM, the misconfigured caching layer was identified as the primary cause. Immediate corrective actions were taken to revert the caching settings to their previous stable configuration. Services were gradually restarted, and by 9:45 AM, dashboard performance had fully recovered.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

In response to this incident, YellowTech has implemented the following measures:
- Enhanced change management processes to include more rigorous testing of caching configurations before deployment.
- Improved monitoring to quickly detect abnormal caching behavior and performance issues.
- Conducted a comprehensive review of caching configurations across critical services to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.

These measures aim to bolster our infrastructure against similar incidents in the future, ensuring consistent and reliable performance for our internal dashboard and other critical services.
